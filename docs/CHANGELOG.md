# Changelog

## V0.1 (unreleased)

First delivery. Scaffolds Pree as a Bluestaq App Store `python` container app against the
Foundations baseline.

● The scoring core: an explainable, confidence-tiered assessment over five weighted
  indicators, where an absent indicator is excluded from the weighting and marked
  `TBC, re-verify` rather than defaulted to a number.
● The HTTP surface: a `create_app` factory, the five conventional health paths, a separate
  storage proof, a secret-free diagnostics read-out, and the gated scoring and read routes.
● The security posture: constant-time token compare, fail-closed boot on an unsafe token and
  origin pairing, boundary validation, two-tier rate limiting, and sanitised audit lines.
● The store: atomic writes with a backup, forward migration, and merges that never shrink.
● The container: hash-locked install in a build stage, a prep stage whose last mutation is the
  suid and sgid sweep, and a flattened `FROM scratch` ship stage.
● The loop: `ruff`, `mypy` over source and tests, `pytest` with a Cobertura report, and
  `pip-audit`, at 99% coverage against a gate bar of 80%.

Ten defects found by the binding engineering and security gates on first review are fixed in
this release, each with a named regression test:

● Production booted with the authentication gate open, and the deployment table instructed the
  operator into exactly that state. Production now refuses to start without a token.
● A refused write moved the live snapshot aside before writing, so a full volume destroyed the
  dataset and it read back as empty. The replacement is now written first and swapped in
  atomically, with a backup fallback on read.
● Two workers lost writes to an unsynchronised read-modify-write. Serialised by an exclusive
  lock across the whole operation.
● The packaging script matched banned entries as substrings, so `.env` hit `.env.example` and
  no archive could be built. The pipeline simulation had therefore never run to completion.
● `.gitignore` was absent from the archive while a test asserted on it, which would have failed
  the platform's test stage and killed the deploy.
● The container HEALTHCHECK path was rate limited, so rejected traffic could restart the pod.
● Request bodies had no cap, and the framework buffers the whole body before the token gate.
● A non-finite number turned a boundary rejection into a 500 that echoed the caller's input.
● The fine rate-limit tier was keyed on a caller-supplied header, so a fresh label per request
  bypassed it. Both tiers now key on the peer address.
● A corrupt snapshot raised through module import, so the pod never bound and left no
  diagnosable surface at all.
